Welcome to the BSL-IDE, an IDE intended to allow live evaluation of programs.

Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure you can run `npm` commands on a terminal or command prompt. (Test on your machine by running `npm -v`)

To set up the project clone this repository and run `npm install` in the student-language-ide directory.

To run tests without the browser run `npm test`.

Here are two programs to try in the tool: `(+ 2 2)`, `define`.
Can you figure out how to make longer arithmetic expressions and how to use define without getting an error?
