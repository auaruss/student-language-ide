Welcome to the BSL-IDE, an IDE intended to allow live evaluation of programs.

Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure you can run `npm` commands on a terminal or command prompt. (Test on your machine by running `npm -v`)

To set up the project clone this repository and run `npm install` in the student-language-ide directory. Then run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to get the `ng` command.

To run tests without the browser run `npm test`.
To run the tests with browser run `ng test`.

To run the project run `ng serve` and navigate to http://localhost:4200/
(Consider setting up a netlify server for your project.)
(If the CSS seems messed up and doesn't let you type, press Ctrl-Shift-R to reset the browser).
